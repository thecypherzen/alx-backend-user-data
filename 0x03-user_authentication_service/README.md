# Overview #

## Background Context ##
In practice, you should not implement your own authentication system but instead, use a module or framework that does it for you (like in Python-Flask: Flask-User). 

This project however, is for the purpose of learning so we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing. So in when your supervisor says let's modify this "authentication service", you won't be taken aback.
